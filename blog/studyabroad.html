<h1>Study abroad in Korea</h1>
</div>
<p>Studying abroad in South Korea was a very valuable experience for me. The experience of living in a foreign country and confronting all of the challenges that come with it is something that I believe spurs growth in people. From this I have gained confidence in traveling alone and dealing with unfamiliar circumstances. While I have traveled alone in Japan before, where I knew more of the language, studying abroad was a completely different experience for me. In this post I hope to outline the basics of the program, the benefits I felt I gained from studying abroad, why I felt it was worth it, some cultural aspects of Korea I found interesting, and more. I hope this will influence others to choose to study abroad and grow as world citizens. <br /> <br />
It's a very special thing to feel at home at many cities in the world <br /> <br />
I'll begin by discussing my background as a traveler. While I have often visited China, almost always to see family, I have also visited Japan quite frequently as well. Because of its better relations with the US, and better integration with Google services, traveling Japan had been more convenient for me. Combining this with the fact my high school offered Japanese classes but not Chinese meant that I felt more comfortable in Japan. My longest travel in Japan was with a friend who also studied Japanese in college, which was during the winter break between 2022-2023. We made our way from Okinawa to Ishigaki island to Osaka, winding through Honshu to end up back in Tokyo. Through this I discovered the joy of talking with locals in their own language, and understanding their culture deeper. My most memorable experiences in Japan were spontaneous conversations with locals who didn't speak English. I also gained a Scuba diving license, and have gained an interest in more adventerous travels that I hope to pursue in the future. Many of my other travels have taken me to Hawaii, Europe and other countries, but this post should focus on Korea.<br /> <br />
I decided to do the Yonsei Exchange Student program offered through my school, UC Berkeley. This was done through UCEAP, the UC Education Abroad Program. In this, we were required to take 15 units, which often consisted of a language class and 3 other normal classes. Language classes gave 6 units, and other classes gave 3. I think the Yonsei program is the best of the Korean study abroad, as it remains a top 3 Korean University while providing by far hte best social experience. Its proximity to exciting areas such as Hongdae and Myeongdong compared to Seoul National University and Korea University is a huge benefit. The student culture as well promotes social activity, with both local students and international exchange students. Two of the classes I took besides the language one were non-major classes, and were taught in English. I also took Info Theory for Machine Learning in Korea, which was a highly enjoyable class and was also taught in English. I believe all of the Computer Science department classes are taught in English. This is highly convenient for international students. The program was also very well managed, as the UC system had close contact with the Yonsei staff. I believe around 26 students from Berkeley alone went to Yonsei my semester, and the total number of UC Students probably was around 100. <br /> <br />
From this experience I gained an interesting new perspective on culture worldwide. Korean students at Yonsei tended to party quite hard, and it made me feel that college students everywhere were similar. Even though it seemed that it was almost impossible to get into a top Korean University, the caliber of student didn't seem far removed from Berkeley CS students at all. Note that my experience with CS students at Yonsei was highly limited and essentially consisted of observations from 1 class. The city of Seoul definitely felt especially international as well. However, without knowledge of Korean, it can be difficult to navigate as a first time traveler. Google maps does not work especially well in Korea, as it is not synced for walking or with public transport well. There are apps that perform the same function in Korea, such as Naver maps or KakaoT (the Uber equivalent), but they often require being able to read Korean to use optimally. This is one major difference between Korea and Japan I noticed. The area of Sinchon, where Yonsei is located in Seoul, is nice and packed with interesting things to do. It seems tailored to college students, and provides a much more exciting experience than the city of Berkeley. What comes to mind are cafes with especially tasty desserts, and study cafes open 24/7 for students to study in outside of the dorms. Convenience stores are also significantly more convenient than their counterparts in the US. <br /> <br />
Adjusting to life in Korea was a manageable challenge to me, as an Asian American, as I was quite familiar with Japan and China. However, I chose to come to South Korea as it was a country almost entirely new to me. Asian megacities often embody a &ldquo;walkable city&rdquo; trend, with convenient public transport available and less reliance on cars. I noticed that Korea seemed to be more dependent on cars than Japan, but this could just be the difficulties of navigating public transit without knowing Korean. However, it was quite natural to feel isolated on occasion, and finding a good group of friends was quite important. I was very lucky in this regard, and count myself fortunate to meet some very interesting people to share my experience with. As Korean restaurants often refused service to customers going alone, this induced an increase to the amount of socialization I did each day, which I feel was quite valuable. <br /> <br />
Studying in Korea also made it possible for me to travel to other countries while studying. International travel was impossible until the 3rd month of the semester sadly, as we needed to wait for the Alien Registration Card, but once it was possible my friends and I planned a two week trip that began in Taiwan and ended in Japan. My previous experience in Japan and knowledge of the language gave me responsibility which I used to make a more enjoyable trip for all. Overall, some of my best memories were in both the travel I did outside of Korea and the studying and travels I did within Korea. <br /> <br />
I feel the study abroad was worth it in that it gave me an opportunity to be social and meet new people while inducing growth in my maturity and studies. The very nature of living in a foreign country for a long period of time causes change in ones&rsquo; perspective and makes one appreciate difference cultures and personalities among people. I feel the experience transformed me into more of a global citizen, and I am more willing to explore and adventurous than before. </p>
