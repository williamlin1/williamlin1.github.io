<h2>About me</h2>
<p>I received by B.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics from UC Berkeley with high honors in 2023. I am currently a Masters student in the EECS department at UC Berkeley and will be graduating in 2024. I am studying algorithms and am grateful to be advised by Satish Rao.
<br /> <br />
My main interests in computer science lie in algorithms and cs theory. I am especially interested in approximation algorithms, for their mathematical bounds, and randomized algorithms, for their clean efficiency. I am enthusiastic about algorithms and tools for improving them. I am currently interested in acquiring knowledge and experience in artificial intelligence and machine learning as well, and am looking for chances to gain experience here.<br /> <br />
For fun I spend time rock climbing, running, and swimming. I also organize a reading group for books I like, and am interested in learning East Asian languages. </p>

<h3>Current work</h3>
<p>I am working with Professor Satish Rao on examining graph decomposition as a method for improving fast algorithms. Many recent advances in runtime for problems (e.g. the recent almost-linear time advance for the max-flow problem) rely on graph decomposition as a subroutine as well as having dynamic data structures robust to adversial randomness. I am currently working on efficient approximation algorithms for the cut conductance problem using the cut matching paradigm with flows and also semidefinite programming.</p>
<h2>Work Experience</h2>
<h3>Stottler Henke Associates Inc (May 22 - Aug 22)</h3>
<p>I was an Artificial Intelligence Developer Intern at Stottler Henke. I was involved in two main projects, one of which was modernizing and simplifying a satelitte scheduling program that essentially approximated solutions to NP-hard problems. This also involved porting it to linux from windows and fixing the issues involved, and improving it so that it could be containerized. I gained much experience with working on large scale projects from this.<br /> <br />
I was the main developer on the second project I worked on, which involved designing a framework for drones to communicate their actions when acting in swarms. The framework also allowed for the use of artificial intelligence techniques to improve the behavior of the drone swarms over time.</p>
