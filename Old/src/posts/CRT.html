			<h2>The Chinese Remainder Theorem</h2>
      <p> &emsp; I want to cover the Chinese Remainder Theorem in this post because I feel it is the
        one topic that a lot of students have trouble with in CS 70. It's a lot more clean and understandable
        than I think most students find it to be, so I want to make it more intuitive for students,
        and help them understand what's going on underneath.</p>
        <hr>
      <h4> So what is the Chinese Remainder Theorem? </h4>
      <p> &emsp; The Chinese Remainder Theorem is a theorem that states that given a set of modular arithmetic
        equations
        $$x \equiv a_1 (\bmod n_1),  x \equiv a_2 (\bmod n_2) \:...\:  x \equiv a_k (\bmod n_k) $$
        such that all \(n_i\) are relatively prime, there exists a unique solution \(\bmod N\),
        $$x \equiv (\sum_{i=1}^k a_ib_i) \bmod N$$
        Where \(b_i = \frac{N}{n_i}(\frac{N}{n_i}^{-1}_{n_i})\), N is \(\prod_{i=1}^k n_i\)and \(\frac{N}{n_i}^{-1}_{n_i}\) is the
        multiplicative inverse (mod \(n_i\)) of the integer \(\frac{N}{n_i}\). Note that \(\frac{N}{n_i}\) is necessarily
        an integer because N is the product of all of the \(n_i\).</p>

      <h4> Ok, so what does that really mean </h4>
      <p> &emsp; I just gave the definition from the current edition of the notes of CS 70 Fall 2020.
        As you can see, they define the inverses, and put a sum together. It's a bit difficult to
        read and really understand what's going on there. Why is there a sum in the first place, and why
        do we need an inverse? It's a bit unclear. </p>
      <p> &emsp; Let's break this down part by part. We take the \(\bmod N\) at the end because we want to restrict x to
        values in \(\bmod N\). So now we need to look at the sum.
        $$x = a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + ... + a_kb_k$$
        I left \(b_i\) in that form so we can derive what \(b_i\) means from the ground up.
        Looking at this, we only have an \(a_i\) in one part of the sum, i.e. the \(a_i\) or \(b_i\) never appear twice.
        This might give us the intuition that we are looking at one equation at this time, so every part of the sum
        does the work for one equation. So, what work are we trying to do?
      </p>
      <br>

      <p> &emsp;
        Lets start off with
        $$x = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + ... + a_k$$
        We want when \(x\) is taken \(\bmod n_1\), we want it to return the value \(a_1\). Thus from the perspective of
        the other parts of the sum we want them to be 0. We can do this by multiplying all of the others by \(n_i\).
        This gives us
        $$x = a_1 + a_2n_1 + a_3n_1 + ... + a_kn_1$$
        But we don't just want this for \(a_1\), we want this for every A. Thus we would get
        $$x = a_1(n_2*n_3*n_4...) + a_2(n_1*n_3*n_4...) + ... + a_k(n_1*n_2*n_3...)$$
        But because we know \(N\) is defined as the product of all of the \(n_i\), and for every \(a_j\) we want to multiply
        by every \(n_i\) apart from \(n_j\), we would get \(\frac{N}{n_i}\).
        Thus we get
        $$x = a_1\frac{N}{n_1}+a_2\frac{N}{n_2}+a_3\frac{N}{n_3} + ... + a_k\frac{N}{n_k}$$
      </p>
      <br>
      <p> &emsp;
        This has let us isolate every equation into a single statement in the sum. But wait, doesn't \(\frac{N}{n_i}\)
        multiply the value of \(a_i\)? Yes it does! This is why we need to also multiply by the inverse of \(\frac{N}{n_i}\)
        \(\bmod n_i\). This gives us
        $$x = a_1\frac{N}{n_1}(\frac{N}{n_1}^{-1}_{n_i})+a_2\frac{N}{n_2}(\frac{N}{n_2}^{-1}_{n_2}) + ... + a_k\frac{N}{n_k}(\frac{N}{n_k}^{-1}_{n_k})$$
        Thus when we take \(\bmod n_i\), \(\frac{N}{n_i}(\frac{N}{n_1}^{-1}_{n_i})\) is equal to 1,
        because we multiply a value by its inverse. And because it's just multiplication by a constant,
        our part is still 0 when \(\bmod n_i\) for any other \(n_i\). Isn't that pretty beautiful?
        Just to show,
        $$x \equiv a_1\frac{N}{n_1}(\frac{N}{n_1}^{-1}_{n_i})+ 0 + ... + 0 \equiv a_1 \ \ (\bmod n_1)$$
        $$x \equiv 0 + a_2\frac{N}{n_2}(\frac{N}{n_2}^{-1}_{n_2}) + ... + 0 \equiv a_2 \ \ (\bmod n_2)$$
        $$x \equiv 0 + 0 + ... + a_k\frac{N}{n_k}(\frac{N}{n_k}^{-1}_{n_k}) \equiv a_k \ \ (\bmod n_k)$$

      <h4> Walkthrough through a simple problem </h4>

			<p> &emsp;	I'll pick some random numbers for the n, 7, 11, 17. Note that they don't all have to be prime, they just all need to be
        relatively prime. We'll have \(a_1 = 6\), \(a2 = 10\), \(a_1 = 12\) .
        Thus we have
        $$x = 6 \bmod 7$$
        $$x = 10 \bmod 11$$
        $$x = 12 \bmod 17$$
        Then we know that N is 7*11*17 = 1309. \(\frac{N}{n_1} = 187\), \(\frac{N}{n_2} = 119\), \(\frac{N}{n_3} = 77\). For now I'll use
        a computer to find inverses, but I'll outline a cool way in another blog post.
        $$(\frac{N}{n_1}^{-1}_{n_1}) = (187^{-1}_{7}) = 3$$
        $$(\frac{N}{n_1}^{-1}_{n_1}) = (119^{-1}_{11}) = 5$$
        $$(\frac{N}{n_1}^{-1}_{n_1}) = (77^{-1}_{17}) = 2$$
        Then we can say
        $$x = a_1\frac{N}{n_1}(\frac{N}{n_1}^{-1}_{n_i})+a_2\frac{N}{n_2}(\frac{N}{n_2}^{-1}_{n_2}) + a_3\frac{N}{n_3}(\frac{N}{n_3}^{-1}_{n_3})$$
        So finally,
        $$x = 6*187*3 + 10*119*5 + 12*77*2 = 11164 \equiv 692 \bmod 1309$$
        As a final check,
        $$692 \bmod 7 \equiv 6 $$
        $$692 \bmod 11 \equiv 10 $$
        $$692 \bmod 17 \equiv 12 $$
        Thus, we have found the unique value \(\bmod 1309 \) fitting the equations.

			<h4> Connection to polynomial interpolation </h4>
      <p> &emsp; Polynomial interpolation is a method to generate a polynomial passing through k points. Given
        $$(x_1,y_1),(x_2,y_2),...,(x_n,y_n)$$
        We can construct a polynomial of degree \(n-1\) that goes through each of these points. The way to do so
        is almost exactly the same as the Chinese remainder theorem except with polynomials.
        Instead of multiplying by \(n_i\) in order to reduce the others to 0, we can multiply by \((x-x_i)\).
        This will give us a value of 0 at every other point, and a nonzero-value at ours. To make it 1, we then
        divide by \((x_i - x_j)\) Where j takes on all values apart from \(i\), and \(i\) is the current
        part of the equation we are looking at. Then we just multiply by \(y_i\). Try it yourself, and see if
        you get a polynomial that passes through all of these points!

      <h4> Ending thoughts </h4>
      <p> &emsp; I hope you found this small writeup entertaining, and I hope you learned something. I didn't go
        into some of the ideas behind it too deeply, such as why all \(n_i\) have to be relatively prime, but you
        can see that by the fact that an inverse must exist for each \(n_i\) for \(\frac{N}{n_i}\). I'll maybe
        try to go into finding inverses in the next writeup if I end up writing more, or maybe a different topic.
        Thanks for reading!
