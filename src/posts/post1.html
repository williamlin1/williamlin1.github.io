			<h2> Rushing through college</h2>
			<p> &emsp;	When I was writing my college apps, I was very confident in what I wanted to do.
        Like many other high school dreamers, I wanted to start a CS company with an app idea
        that would disrupt current technologies and become a billionaire. I even applied
        for my first choice to the “Management and Technology” program at the University of Pennsylvania
        (I now realize how little that actually fit my personality). I want to discuss how my views have
        changed through my first year in college, and where I am now.
			<p> &emsp; Growing up, I started reading a lot of nonfiction about companies. I specifically remember
				 in 6th grade reading “The Facebook Effect” during my class even when my teacher told me to put it away.
				  I thought the stories of people who changed the world from their bedrooms and garages were the coolest.
					 I had no qualms about it that I wanted to be an engineer. When my parents asked if I considered
					 being a doctor, I felt that while a doctor changes one life at a time, a simple program can change
					 millions to billions at a time. The impact just felt different.</p>
			<p> &emsp; Currently I am a student studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at UC Berkeley.
				I still feel that programming can influence the world greatly, but I am rethinking about the value of
				passion in what I do. Obviously in all of my books, those who made massive companies were those who
				 really loved computers and building things. </p>
			<p> &emsp; My first semester at UC Berkeley, I took 3 classes: CS 61a, CS 70, and EE16a. They’re all
				computer science related technical courses, because I was so certain I wanted to pursue computer science.
				 While they were all fascinating courses and I was engaged in the material, it was technically quite
				 challenging. My second semester, I took CS 189, CS 170 and CS 61b. Again a heavily technical courseload.
				 At Berkeley to graduate EECS we only need to take 5 upper-division CS courses, and I’ve already completed 2. </p>
			<p> &emsp; Thinking about how I spent my courses, in my freshman year I’ve taken 6 technical classes
				already, and 0 breadths. Freshman year is supposed to be a time to explore, to learn new things, to
				find your passions. But I just stuck with CS techs. Looking back, I think it would’ve been a good
				idea to take breadth classes and humanities in order to expand my perspective. I feel that Berkeley
				gives a lot of time to complete your major requirements, so that you have free time to explore new things.
				It’s explore vs exploit, and I seem to have a pretty skewed ratio against exploring so far.</p>
			<p> &emsp; I’m personally a pretty introspective person, so I like to think about how I want to live my life.
				I’m not sure who’s reading this (if anyone), but I’m just trying to put my thoughts out for myself as well. </p>
			<p> &emsp; I recently reread this article from Clayton M. Christensen in the Harvard Business Review.
				In the final paragraphs there is a quote that stood out to me: “I know I’ve had a substantial impact.
				But as I’ve confronted this disease, it’s been interesting to see how unimportant that impact is to me now.
				I’ve concluded that the metric by which God will assess my life isn’t dollars but the individual people whose
				lives I’ve touched.” The article as a whole describes principles of how to live your life, but Christensen
				states that what really mattered to him at the end was the people he interacted with.</p>
			<p> &emsp;
				In the end I’m not sure how much happiness building a big company and gaining money would bring me.
				We spent a huge amount of time at work so I think it should be something you feel fulfilled by, even
 			just being a part in it. In software engineering, you do make a lot of money and get really perks,
 		but the work may not really make you fulfilled. I think that the ideal job makes you feel fulfilled,
  	has interesting work, and is something you’re passionate about. I still feel computers are really interesting,
	 	and I want to make my living in them, but I’m trying to find what I really love to work on.
	 	But I still have 3 more years of college to explore.</p>
